## Centrality

### Degree centrality
The degree centrality of a node is its degree â€” the number of edges it has. The higher the degree, the more connected the node is.

`cy.$().dc({ root: #${id}}).degree;`


### Eigenvector centrality
Cytoscape rank the nodes in the collection using the [Page Rank algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank). PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a node to determine a rough estimate of how important the node is. The underlying assumption is that more important nodes are likely to receive more links from other nodes.

`cy.elements().pageRank().rank(#${id});`

## Source Data
